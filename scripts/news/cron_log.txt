            'his birth mother. And what little he knew, he said, '
            'stung.</p><p>His adoption papers listed her name, Hilda del '
            'Carmen Quezada; her age, 26; the date, March 2, 1983; and the '
            'hospital where she gave birth to him in central Chile. The '
            'documents also included a judge’s note saying Quezada gave him up '
            'because she had little money and “other children to '
            'support.”</p><p></p><p>“I never thought that any excuse would be '
            'good enough,” said Graf, who is now a firefighter in Houston. “I '
            'carried that animosity, that chip on my shoulder, my whole '
            'life.”</p><p>The claim that his mother willingly gave him up '
            'hurt, Graf said, until he learned this year that he is one of '
            'hundreds — possibly thousands — of Chilean adoptees taken from '
            'their parents without their consent during the country’s military '
            'dictatorship.</p><p></p><p>Quezada, it turned out, had not '
            'surrendered her son; she was told the baby, born three months '
            'premature, had died.</p><p>“Two weeks after the birth, they told '
            'me he had died,” Quezada said. “I asked for the body and they '
            'refused, saying it was too small.”</p><p>Investigators looking '
            'into coercive adoptions in Chile since the first cases came to '
            'light in 2014 have come to a stunning conclusion: The practice '
            'was widespread during the rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who '
            'actively encouraged overseas adoptions to reduce poverty in the '
            '1970s and 1980s. The process was abetted by a vast network of '
            'officials — including judges, social workers, health '
            'professionals and adoption brokers — who forged documents and are '
            'widely assumed to have taken bribes.</p><p>More than 550 adoptees '
            'have reconnected with their birth families in recent years. But '
            'investigators say the scheme, which is still being uncovered, '
            'most likely involved many more children.</p><p>Judicial officials '
            'in Chile are investigating roughly 650 cases of irregular '
            'adoptions, a phenomenon the Ministry of Justice called in a '
            'statement “extremely serious.”</p><p>Mario Carroza, a Chilean '
            'judge who opened a criminal inquiry into the adoptions in 2018, '
            'said investigators were looking into the circumstances of about '
            '8,000 overseas adoptions that took place from 1970 to 1999. '
            'Carroza said the number of cases under scrutiny could reach '
            '20,000.</p><p>In October, Sweden began an investigation into the '
            'irregular adoptions, responding to pressure from Chilean adoptees '
            'raised in the country who have used DNA testing to establish '
            'their connections to birth parents in Chile who have been missing '
            'a child.</p><p>Pinochet seized power in 1973, in a bloody coup '
            'that toppled Chile’s left-wing president. He then led a brutal '
            'regime in which the country’s economy grew as thousands of '
            'opponents were executed, disappeared, detained, tortured and '
            'exiled.</p><p>Years after the general’s death in 2006, Chileans '
            'have been horrified to learn how pervasive coercive adoptions '
            'became on his watch.</p><p>“The history of human rights '
            'violations during the dictatorship is known: the torture, '
            'political prisoners, repression, but this one has been largely '
            'invisible,” said Boris Barrera, a member of Congress who led a '
            'legislative investigation into the matter in 2018.</p><p>Reports '
            'of coercive adoptions in Chile predate the dictatorship. But the '
            'practice became chillingly common starting in the late 1970s, as '
            'the Pinochet government explicitly began promoting adoptions '
            'during a period of economic crisis, said Karen Alfaro Monsalve, a '
            'professor at Chile’s Austral University who has researched the '
            'history of the coercive adoptions.</p><p>“What we ultimately had '
            'was an outflow of poor children who were seen as a stumbling '
            'block to achieve the country’s economic development,” Alfaro '
            'Monsalve said. “Pinochet had a type of forced migration that '
            'helped control population growth and enable the country’s '
            'neoliberal shift.”</p><p>The abusive practice came under scrutiny '
            'in 2014 after the Chilean investigative news agency CIPER '
            'published an article on a handful of coercive adoptions, '
            'documenting the roles played by a priest and a doctor. In the '
            'years that followed, as scores of adoptees raised in Chile and '
            'abroad set out to trace their roots, many using DNA ancestry '
            'tests, a disturbing pattern came into sharper '
            'focus.</p><p>Hundreds of women came forward with similar accounts '
            'of unexpectedly losing their babies soon after giving birth. Some '
            'were told they were stillborn, while others said government '
            'officials took custody of them.</p><p>The congressional committee '
            'led by Barrera culminated in a call for the Chilean government to '
            'establish a truth and reparations commission and to build a DNA '
            'database to enable adoptees and biological families to connect. '
            'But so far no one has been charged in connection with the '
            'abductions.</p><p>Judicial officials have tempered expectations '
            'by noting that statutes of limitations will make it hard to bring '
            'individuals to justice.</p><p>Constanza del Río, one of the '
            'founders of Nos Buscamos, an organization that helps adoptees who '
            'were trafficked, said the government’s failure to investigate the '
            'crimes more diligently was inexcusable.</p><p>“We don’t have the '
            'next 25 years for them to investigate at turtle pace because we '
            'have mothers who are dying,” she said. “Justice may come, but it '
            'will be too late.”</p><p>Quezada, 65, who has three daughters, '
            'never made peace with the loss of her son. She mourned him every '
            'year on his birthday, she said. Decades later, she could still '
            'picture the prominent black eyes that stared back at her from an '
            'incubator the last time she saw him.</p><p>When news articles '
            'about illegal adoptions began circulating, Quezada was horrified, '
            'she said, but she never allowed herself a glimmer of hope — until '
            'her phone rang one day last May.</p><p>The caller was Marisol '
            'Rodríguez, the founder of Hijos y Madres del Silencio — Children '
            'and Mothers of Silence — a volunteer organization that has '
            'facilitated the reconnection of more than 250 families severed by '
            'coerced adoptions.</p><p>Rodríguez explained to Quezada the '
            'unlikely chain of events that led to the call. Years ago, '
            'Rodríguez said, her son, who was a firefighter, had gone to '
            'Houston for a training exercise. There he struck a friendship '
            'with an American firefighter who said he had been adopted from '
            'Chile.</p><p>The son offered to try to track down his new '
            'friend’s birth parents, and returned to Chile with copies of his '
            'adoption file. Once he was home, he turned the documents over to '
            'Rodríguez’s group, which saw in the file telltale signs of a '
            'coerced adoption.</p><p>Quezada was dumbfounded.</p><p>“I '
            'couldn’t digest the information,” she said. “I couldn’t grasp '
            'what was happening.”</p><p>But shock gave way to a burning desire '
            'to make up for lost time. Days after learning the news, Quezada '
            'made a video call, and laid eyes on her son as an adult for the '
            'first time.</p><p>“Every muscle in my body tightened up and '
            'squeezed the tears in my eyes,” Graf recalled. “I felt like I had '
            'been hit by a bat and was seeing stars.”</p><p>Within weeks, '
            'Quezada boarded an airplane for the first time in her life and '
            'flew to Houston. In a reunion arranged by a local journalist, '
            'Quezada surprised her son, who crumpled into his mother’s '
            'arms.</p><p>“It was the closest hug,” Graf recalled. “They just '
            'left us alone in each other’s arms and we hugged and she kissed '
            'me and we just stood there crying.”</p><p>Some Chilean adoptees '
            'have found a very different response after tracking down a birth '
            'parent. Maria Diemar, who was raised in Sweden after being flown '
            'from Chile as a baby in 1975, spent years hunting down clues that '
            'eventually led her to track down her birth family in southern '
            'Chile.</p><p>She learned that her mother, who had worked as a '
            'live-in maid when she was born, had been forced to give up the '
            'baby by her employer at the time. News that her missing daughter '
            'was trying to make contact was unwelcome because, Diemar was '
            'told, her mother was in an abusive relationship with a man who '
            'did not know about the birth.</p><p>That did not deter Diemar '
            'from digging into the case of her younger brother, Daniel, who '
            'was also adopted from Chile. The boy’s mother, too, had been told '
            'he died during birth. The two have grown close in recent years, '
            'which Diemar counts as a victory.</p><p>“It has meant so much to '
            'travel to Chile with Daniel, to share the story of our '
            'upbringing, our childhood, and just to be in the country where we '
            'were supposed to be,” she said. “It’s very healing to do this '
            'together.”</p><p>Diemar said she had little faith that the '
            'investigations underway in Chile and Sweden would lead to '
            'prosecutions.</p><p>“But I think it’s important that the history '
            'books say that this happened,” she said. “These were '
            'crimes.”</p><p>Since reconnecting with his mother, Graf has '
            'experienced emotional whiplash. There have been flashes of anger, '
            'moments of gratitude and feelings of indignation.</p><p>But '
            'ultimately, reconnecting with his birth mother was so healing and '
            'clarifying that he created an organization to supply free kits '
            'from the company MyHeritage DNA to adoptees and families who '
            'believe they may have had a stolen baby.</p><p>“We’re making up '
            'for 38 years of lost time,” he said. “Time we can’t get '
            'back.”</p>',

            'different and, frankly, much more interesting '
            'viewpoint.</p><p>According to them, Earth was once parched and '
            'almost waterless, and our oceans were merely the result of ice '
            'and water raining down from extraterrestrial '
            'sources.</p><p></p><p>Yes, aliens gave us water! The theory '
            'suggests that extraterrestrials may be responsible for most of '
            'the 332,500,000 cubic miles of water covering our planet '
            'today.</p><p>And...drumroll, please...now, British scientists are '
            'backing up the hypothesis that our seas are actually from "out of '
            'this world."</p><p>Studying grains of material from an asteroid '
            'called 25143 Itokawa brought back to Earth by a Japanese robot '
            'probe, this group of scientists concluded that these grains '
            'support the hypothesis that our oceans came from outer '
            'space.</p><p>Luke Daly, of the University of Glasgow, says that '
            'the dust they studied provides compelling evidence that our '
            'oceans were formed from water from other parts of the solar '
            'system. He says that there is strong evidence that at least half '
            'of the water on Earth has been filtered by interplanetary '
            'dust.</p><p>The scientists report in a paper published in Nature '
            'Astronomy that the grains brought back from the asteroid '
            'contained a significant amount of water. Daly and his colleagues '
            'examined grains of dust returned from Itokawa 25143 using '
            'atom-probe tomography. By using this technique, scientists can '
            'count atoms one by one in a sample.\xa0</p><p>As Daly explains, '
            'this water was most likely created by the solar wind, a stream of '
            'particles emanating from the Sun. In the clouds of dust that '
            'float throughout the solar system, these particles would have '
            'interacted with oxygen atoms to create water molecules which '
            "would have built up in the clouds over the solar system's "
            'history.</p><p>The dust grains, as well as their water, would '
            'have been mopped up by the Earth as it orbited the Sun. According '
            'to an argument, this would have allowed water, which Leonardo da '
            'Vinci once called "the driving force of all nature," to filter '
            'down from the skies onto the earth.</p><p>Professor Martin Lee of '
            'the University of Glasgow, who was part of the group, stressed '
            'that all the water that is found in our seas did not come from '
            'solar dust grains.\xa0</p><p>Ice from comets and asteroids '
            'crashing on Earth would have made an equally substantial '
            'contribution. According to Lee, solar dust and icy comets '
            'provided us with the oceans in which life then '
            'evolved.</p><p>This discovery is important not only for providing '
            'compelling evidence about the origins of water on Earth, but for '
            'several other reasons as well. It implies that there may be water '
            'on other worlds in our solar system, perhaps in the form of ice. '

            'popular television show in the world, and it was Netflix’s second '
            'most-viewed TV debut to that point. Then COVID-19 set in, and two '
            'years passed without more “Witcher.” A few shows, notably “Squid '
            'Game,” overtook it in the all-time Netflix rankings. But Season 1 '
            'of “The Witcher” is still hanging in there, comfortably in fifth '
            'place.</p><p></p><p>That’s impressive, and a little surprising, '
            'for a “Game of Thrones”-on-a-budget sword-and-sorcery adventure '
            'whose visual and dramatic quality ranged from “hey, not bad” to '
            '“(helpless giggle).” Maybe it was a testament to the popularity '
            'of the source material, a cycle of stories and novels by Polish '
            'writer Andrzej Sapkowski that has also inspired a successful '
            'video game franchise. Maybe the audience for sprawling medieval '
            'fantasy, even when it’s medium grade, is simply that '
            'large.</p><p>Or maybe people were just drawn in by the show’s '
            'charms, of which it had several: a playful sense of humor (an '
            'area in which it scored quite a bit higher than “Game of '
            'Thrones”); a refreshingly straightforward episodic structure; and '
            'an amusing, minimalist performance by Henry Cavill as the '
            'witcher, Geralt, a mutant mercenary charged with hunting down all '
            'manner of CGI beasts.</p><p></p><p>Now the show’s '
            'pandemic-delayed second season is here, premiering Friday on '
            'Netflix, and based on six of the eight episodes, a lot of what '
            'made the series charming has been set aside. But that may not '
            'stop it from racking up equally impressive viewership numbers '
            'this time around.</p><p>Picking up in the wake of the '
            'scorched-earth battle between kingdoms that ended Season 1, the '
            'show takes Geralt away from peripatetic monster-slaying for hire '
            'and puts him on a narrower path, as bodyguard and teacher to Ciri '
            '(Freya Allan), the refugee princess with mysterious powers. The '
            'third major character, the mage Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), has '
            'lost her magic and is also on the run. Jaskier (Joey Batey), the '
            'traveling bard — the 13th century’s version of a fabulous cabaret '
            'star — who was responsible for much of the sniping humor is '
            'offstage in the early episodes.</p><p>It feels as if, after the '
            'good times of Season 1, the series’ creator and showrunner, '
            'Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, decided it was time to get serious — to '
            'start incorporating more of the elaborate mythology and '
            'terminology of Sapkowski’s books.</p><p>Now there are more and '
            'longer conversations filling in the history of the story’s '
            'setting, called the Continent, and of the various species who '
            'inhabit it, including elves, dwarves and humans. Geralt and Ciri '
            'come off the road and hunker down in a witcher fortress where she '
            'trains to be a warrior, leading to discussions of whether she’s a '
            'savior or a destroyer. (There’s also a sheen of topicality, with '
            'elves representing an oppressed indigenous population.)</p><p>We '
            'also get a raft of new characters, some of whom seem to pop up '
            'out of nowhere; keeping track of all the faces and folklore, not '
            'to mention beasts — a grisly central European menagerie of '
            'wyverns, strzygas, chernobogs and the like — starts to feel like '
            'studying for a final exam without any notes.</p><p>On the '
            'positive side, the influx of new cast members includes Simon '
            'Callow and Liz Carr as a pair of paranormal investigators, Kim '
            'Bodnia of “The Bridge” as a veteran witcher and “Game of Thrones” '
            'alumnus Kristofer Hivju as a tusked nobleman in a subplot '
            'recalling “Beauty and the Beast.” The storylines begin to '
            'coalesce, and the action begins to pick up, around the fifth '
            'episode.</p><p>Cavill, who’s as lethal with a disappointed sigh '
            'or a sidelong glance as Geralt is with a dagger, is still a '
            'steady, engaging presence at the center of the action. Geralt’s '
            'scenes with his new sidekick, the somewhat grim young Ciri, don’t '
            'have the kick of his banter in Season 1 with Jaskier, though. The '
            'new season also finds less time for heart-to-hearts between '
            'Geralt and the one character who really understands him, his '
            'horse, Roach.</p><p>Overall, you probably know whether you’re the '
            'kind of viewer who’s willing to add another complicated Brothers '
            'Grimm-meets-Middle Earth saga to your schedule. And if you like '
            'your costumed fantasies mythology-forward and you find the '
            'mechanics of world building to be an end in themselves, then this '
            'new, more mysterious and portentous season of “The Witcher” may '
            'be for you. Plan accordingly.<br>\r\n'

            'loss is perhaps one of humanity’s greatest challenges '
            'today.</p><p>The age of our planet is estimated to be 4.5 billion '
            'years, of which human beings have only existed for 200,000 years, '
            'i.e., for not even 0.5 per cent of the time and yet compared to '
            'any other species, we have had a far greater impact on our '
            'planet’s health.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the human '
            'population has grown exponentially, yet the landmass available to '
            'us remains the same.</p><p>By some estimates in the last 50 years '
            'itself, our species population has doubled. The growing number of '
            'humans has led to a growing demand for resources, which has led '
            'to overexploitation of the earth’s natural resources. Our demands '
            'have mostly been achieved at the expense of forests, wetlands '
            '&amp; marine ecosystems worldwide.</p><p></p><p>Numerous forests '
            'have been levelled to accommodate our species’ growing '
            'population, disrupting ecosystems, and causing tremendous loss to '
            'biodiversity.</p><p>One of the primary demands, food, is behind '
            'the largest negative impact. To meet the growing demands, '
            'agricultural expansion happened, terrestrial land use was '
            'changed. \xa0Almost 50 per cent of the global land area is used '
            'for agriculture, causing an estimated 80 per cent extinction '
            'threat to animal and bird species.</p><p>According to the Food '
            'and Agriculture Organisation of The United Nations, agriculture '
            'accounts for up to 80 per cent of global deforestation and is the '
            'number one cause of deforestation. But, the loss of forests '
            'happens for many purposes:</p><p>To clear space for the '
            'production of crops like wheat, maize etc.</p><p>To create a '
            'grazing pasture for animals reared to fulfil the rising demand '
            'for meat.</p><p>For logging purposes, i.e., to meet the demand '
            'for wooden products like furniture or the production of '
            'charcoal.</p><p>Forests are also cleared up for mining, as most '
            'of the precious resources like Oil, gold, diamond, copper etc are '
            'found in and around forests. Not only that, but the chemicals '
            'used in the mining process also degrade the quality of soil and '
            'ends up in water bodies, polluting them and harming the riverine '
            'ecosystems.</p><p>Forest fires. According to experts, climate '
            'change &amp; deforestation are drying out forests, making them '
            'more vulnerable to fires.</p><p>Unsustainable human activities '
            'like these are continuously degrading and destroying forests '
            'worldwide. According to World Resources Institute data, we have '
            'witnessed the loss of almost ten per cent of tree cover since the '
            'beginning of this century. In the year 2020 itself, we lost 4.2 '
            'million hectares of forest cover, i.e., area equal to the size of '
            'Netherlands, a twelve per cent jump from 2019.</p><p>By '
            'relentlessly exploiting the earth’s natural resources, we have '
            'not only wiped out forest cover globally but also choked our '
            'water bodies and in doing so we have driven many species of flora '
            'and fauna towards extinction. Excessive use of pesticides in food '
            'production, oil spills etc has not only led to soil depletion but '
            'the runoff of these artificial fertilisers from the fields has '
            'also polluted water bodies causing excessive growth of algae '
            'leading to fatal effects on aquatic life forms.</p><p>Today, with '
            "about 60 per cent of the world's major marine ecosystems being "
            'exploited unsustainably, it is estimated by the year 2100 more '
            "than half of the world's marine life forms may face "
            'extinction.</p><p>A United Nations report from 2019 suggests that '
            'an average of almost 25 per cent or around one million species '
            'from the animal &amp; plant kingdom face an extinction threat, '
            'many within decades if nothing is done to reduce the biodiversity '
            'loss.</p><p>It’s a vicious cycle, human population growth leads '
            'to a decrease in per capita income growth, which tends to lead to '
            'an increase in poverty, which is in turn linked to '
            'Poaching.</p><p>Humans have led many a glorious species to their '
            'end, one of the most shameful examples of which is the Dodo bird. '
            'A flightless bird native to Mauritius, it was discovered in 1592, '
            'and within merely seventy years it went extinct.</p><p>Another '
            'example is the Tasmanian devil, a species made popular by the '
            'cartoon Looney Toons. But do you know, due to hunting and human '
            'encroachment the species went extinct in 1936? Now, the only '
            'reminder of this large marsupial can be found in a children’s '
            'animated cartoon. \xa0</p><p>Illegal poaching has brought all '
            'kinds of precious wildlife to the brink of extinction. Some '
            'examples are Pangolins, Rhinoceroses, Tigers, Hawksbills turtles '
            'and many more.</p><p>Try and comprehend this, all this damage was '
            'done merely out of greed.</p><p>Rapid population growth also '
            'causes intangible damage like Climate change, which is yet '
            'another important factor behind the deteriorating biodiversity '
            '&amp; ecosystems.<br>\r\n'
            'By the end of this century, World temperatures are expected to '
            'rise by 3° to 8°C, which will have a devastating impact on the '
            'planet.</p><p>Experts warn that decades of unsustainable human '
            'activities are bringing the Amazon forest a.k.a. lungs of our '
            'earth to near a tipping point. This forest’s canopy cover plays a '
            'major role in regulating the global climate, with a carbon sink '
            'capacity of around 90-140 billion metric tons. With the current '
            'deforestation trends, the release of even the smallest portion '
            'can lead to an acceleration in global warming.</p><p>Biodiversity '
            'loss also has a direct bearing on the rise of zoonotic diseases, '
            'studies suggest that around 60 per cent of the emerging diseases '
            'in humans are a result of pathogen spillovers from animals to '
            'humans.</p><p>It is important to remember that biodiversity is an '
            'important part of this planet, without which there is no future '
            'for humanity. While no one wants to imagine this planet without '
            'all the thousands of amazing life forms that make up our '
            'ecosystems, mass extinction is a very real threat. Only through '
            'sustainable living, sustainable development and sustainable '
            'population growth can we combat this threat and save our '
            'planet.</p><p>As Mahatma Gandhi once said, “The world has enough '
            "for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed.”</p>",

            'women need to play a central role. Their voices and participation '
            'are crucial to overcome patriarchal mindsets.</p><p>Without '
            'education, women will have fewer opportunities. Poverty, '
            'unemployment and inequality are problems that cannot be solved by '
            "men alone and require women's participation.</p><p>When it comes "
            "to women's empowerment, the men's participation is also "
            'important, as they also need to be aware of decisions that their '
            'family will take.</p><p>The problems and inequalities between the '
            'genders are much greater in rural India. Ten years ago, the '
            'literacy rate for women in rural areas was only 58.8 per cent, '
            'while the national average was 65.46 per cent. Whereas the '
            'national average for men was over 82 per cent.</p><p>For Indian '
            'families in rural areas, girls play the role of a second mother '
            'by doing household work. This can discourage them from going to '
            'school.</p><p>This is where schemes like the Aakar project can be '
            'helpful for women.</p><p><p></p></p><p></p><p><strong>Education – '
            'Powerful tool stemming population '

            'powerful tools. Currently, nearly 40 per cent\xa0of pregnancies '
            'worldwide are unintended, which leads to a staggering 80 million '
            'births per year.</p><p>An increased focus on education around '
            'family planning, birth control, and improved access to '
            'contraceptives can help in population '
            'stabilisation.</p><p><p></p></p><p></p><p><strong>Overpopulation '
            'and poverty</strong></p><p>Poor people are often unable to afford '
            'or access education, depriving them of reaching prosperity for '
            'generations.</p><p>This is where the governments have to step in '
            'and make sure that everyone is provided education.</p><p>With an '
