After the Cougars beat Oregon State on Oct. 9, Rolovich confirmed a USA Today report that he had applied for a religious exemption.", "Asked then if the approaching mandate deadline made him uncomfortable, Rolovich said: \u201cYou think it\u2019s been a fun time? Of course it\u2019s been difficult for everybody. Players are going through some of the same things. I think it\u2019s an incredible stress, especially the young people.

It is a story she told me proudly, within five minutes of our introduction on a video call, while her fingers made a maelstrom of her close-cropped, bleached-blond hair. (By way of explaining this style choice, she burst into a brassy, Ethel Merman-esque voice and sang, \u201cI want to be a shiksa.\u201d)", "But Blair\u2019s candor has come to mean something more in the three years since she went public about her MS diagnosis.

It was now or never. And now or never is a very good definition of Selma.\u201d", "Gellar was also unsure about the film project \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a very private person, I can barely share going to the supermarket,\u201d she said \u2014 but she understood Blair\u2019s position: She felt it was important for her son.", "As Gellar recalled, \u201cShe would say, \u2018God forbid, if I don\u2019t make it, then Arthur has a whole video diary of what I went through. He\u2019ll never have to wonder, did I give up? He\u2019ll know how hard I fought to be there for him.\u2019 \u201d", "To Parker Posey, a friend and colleague of Blair\u2019s for nearly 20 years, the decision to make a documentary was as much a legitimate form of expression as any other artistic enterprise.", "\u201cThis is the only thing we have \u2014 your life as an actor, it\u2019s all material, it\u2019s all story,\u201d Posey said. \u201cAm I going to land in something that gives me meaning, away from the pettiness of most entertainment?\u201d", "Posey added, \u201cAnyone who can find purpose in creating what they\u2019re supposed to create and bravely live their life, that\u2019s art.

There was really no directing, and I mean that in the best way.\u201d", "She added, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve realized that a film is coming out where I\u2019m the subject of it. I haven\u2019t really processed that.\u201d", "With our half-hour coming to its end, we said our goodbyes, and I told Blair I looked forward to reconnecting with her in a few days. In a comically ethereal voice, she answered, \u201cGod willing, if I\u2019m alive.\u201d", "Our next session, planned for that Monday, had to be delayed when Blair fell from a horse she was riding over the weekend. As she told me in a follow-up conversation \u2014 this time over the phone, as video calls were making it difficult for her to focus \u2014 she had lost her balance and hyperextended her thumb but was otherwise doing OK.", "She was more embarrassed by how she felt she\u2019d behaved in our first conversation, using her admittedly outrageous sense of humor to paper over her anxiety. \u201cI get so spooked because there is still, even in my mind, a stigma of, you won\u2019t bring it \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to make this mind-body thing work,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll use the defense of a shtick when I feel like I\u2019m faltering.\u201d", "She was also bothered by a remark she had seen on her Instagram account from someone who offered support for her documentary but said, as Blair described the comment, \u201cI wish a regular person were doing it, like a person that\u2019s not a celebrity, because it\u2019s not the same.\u201d", "Blair emphatically added, \u201cI am a regular person.\u201d", "This article originally appeared in The New York Times."],
